# bike_share_capstone
A capstone project done for the Google Data Analytics Certificate, using a scenario and data provided by Google.

This capstone included a scenario in which I, as a data analyst working for the ficticious company "Cyclistic", a bike sharing company, must analyze riding trends between two categories of riders to improve the marketing campaign and direction of the company.

Included in this repository is:
- bikes_markdown: The final report that would be presented to executives at Cyclistic. This report was constructed using R Markdown and exported in HTML.
- bikes: The original R file used to collect, clean, analyze and visualize the data provided by Google.
- 202007-divvy-tripdata: A subset of the dataset used for this project. Due to size limitations, the full dataset cannot be uploaded to GitHub.
